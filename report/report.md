## Abstract

With the introduciton of technology into sports, data scientists are sliding headfirst into Major League Baseball. With the introduction of Statcast in 2015, The MLB has been looking at different ways to use technology in the game. In 2020 alone, the MLB introduce several different types of technologies to keep the fans engaged with the games while not being able to attend them. In this paper, we will be exploring a predictive model to claffiy pitches thrown by each pitcher in the MLB. We will be using a database that includes the release speed, the release spin, and the pitch type. With this information, we can compare collected data to determine the pitch type thrown by looking at the recorded spin and speed of the ball.

## 1. Introduction 

Big data is everywhere and has been used in sports for years. Especially in Major League Baseball, where big data has been analyzed for various things. For example, in the movie Moneyball (which is based on true events), the general manager of the Oakland Aâ€™s uses analytics to find players that will win them games that other teams overlook. They used many different statistics; batting average, batting average with runners on base, fielding percentage, etc., to find these players. Not only do teams use big data to find the right players for them, the MLB also uses it for their Statcast technology. Statcast was implemented in 2015 and is an automated tool that analyzes data to deliver accurate statistics in real time [^1].  This technology tracks many different aspects of the game, including many different pitching statistics.

While there is a lot of data about pitching, we will only be focusing on release speed, release spin, pitch type, and the pitcher for our model.  And while there is a lot of data about these different pitches and the pitchers, it can still be difficult to predict exactly what type of pitch is thrown according to the pitcher. For instance, the difference between different types of fastballs, a four-seam and two-seam, can be different by less than a mile per hour and forty rotations per minute (as thrown by Aaron Nola of the Philadelphia Phillies). In our model that we try to create, we are use these variables, along with the last three pitches thrown for each pitch type, to try to predict what pitch was just thrown.
