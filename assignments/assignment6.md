# AI For Efficient Diagnostics and Reduced Error
Artificial intelligence is transforming the medical field. This type of computing has helped save the live as many as doctors are now able to diagnose patients more accurately. By using AI, doctors are also able to make predictions about their patients’ future health and provide better treatments. The process of using AI to improve the diagnostic process is important to healthcare because in 2015, the “misdiagnosis illness and medical error account for 10% of all US deaths” [1].

Doctors have large caseloads and are not always able to complete medical records of their patients. And these incomplete records can lead to the misdiagnosis of their patients in the future.  Which was the main reason behind the 10% of all US deaths. Because of this, doctors and scientists have come together to reduce this number by introducing AI to healthcare. AI is immune to making these types of errors and can predict and diagnose patients at a faster rate than medical professionals by using medical data in algorithms and deep learning designed specifically for healthcare [1].

# AI Technologies
There are many different AI technologies that are being used to reduce errors and save lives. Some of these technologies are:
  * ### Pathai ### is a deep learning technology that assists pathologists in making more accurate diagnoses regarding cancer [2].
  *	### Buoy Health ### is a chatbot that uses algorithms to diagnose illnesses and recommend treatment [3].
  *	### Enlitic ### is another deep learning technology that uses data to make medical diagnostics. This technology gives doctors a “better insight into a patient’s real-time data” [1] by pairing doctors with data scientists and engineers to make diagnostics sooner and more accurate [4].
  *	### Freenome ### is a biotechnology company that uses AI to detect cancer in its earliest stages. They do this by using algorithms that look at medical screenings and blood work to help detect patterns in cancer patients [5].

Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool that is providing more accurate diagnostics at a faster rate with less error than the previous ways.
